<h1>GSR wage-theft at UCSD</h1>

<p>
Despite a guarantee of normative 50% GSR appointments, a guarantee acknowledged at every other campus in the system, UCSD has refused to end under-appointment and has taken the matter to arbitration before the Public Employee Relations Board. Rather than pay us what we're owed, UCSD has charged 59 workers with physical assault in connection with a peaceful protest and jailed 3 workers on felony vandalism for writing messages with sidewalk chalk. 
</p>

<p>
Why is UCSD resorting to such authoritarian abuses in response to peaceful worker protests? Because they owe each worker thousands of dollars, and they know it. Use this website to track how much money UCSD owes you since ratification of our contract.
